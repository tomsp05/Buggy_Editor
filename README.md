# CS1999 Racing Buggy editor


This "buggy editor" code is the skeleton of an application for editing a racing buggy.

It runs as a webserver so you can edit the configuration of a buggy in your
browser. The editor can then generate the data, in JSON format, that you need
in order to enter races on the [Buggy Race Server](http://rhul.buggyrace.net).

The application is written in Python3 using the
[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) micro-framework.

> It's written in a way which you can and should fix! You should be able
> to get it up and running without needing to change the code...
> but from that point on you'll need to change pretty much everything to make
> it better. 


## Getting Started
